        Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bengali: কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম, pronounced [kaːd͡ʒi nod͡ʒrul ɪslam] (listen); 
        26 May 1899 – 29 August 1976) was a Bengali poet, writer, musician, and is the national poet of Bangladesh
        .[7] Nazrul is regarded as one of the greatest poets in Bengali literature. Popularly known as Nazrul,
         he produced a large body of poetry, music, messages, novels, stories, etc. with themes that included
          equality, justice, anti-imperialism, humanity, rebellion against oppression and religious devotion.[8]
           Nazrul's activism for political and social justice as well as writing a poem titled as "Bidrohī",
            meaning "the rebel" in Bengali, earned him the title of "Bidrohī Kôbi" (Rebel Poet).
